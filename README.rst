notifymuch
==========

This is a simple program that displays desktop notifications for unread
mail (or actually any search query) in the notmuch database. The notification
can optionally have a button to run a mail client.

When a message is shown in a notification, it is internally marked as 'recently
seen' and not shown again for two days (configurable).


Installation and usage
----------------------

The program requires Python 3, setuptools, pygobject and notmuch. Notmuch isn't
available on PyPI anymore, so you need to install it separately using either
your system package manager(available for Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and other major
distributions) or directly from sources. It is generally called
`python3-notmuch`.

It can be installed together with rest of its dependencies using::

    pip install .

To use, execute ``notifymuch`` after new mail is indexed (for example in a
*post-new* hook). The program forks and stays in the background while the
notification is active. If upon launch a notification is already active, it
is updated.


Configuration
-------------

Configuration is stored in ``~/.config/notifymuch/notifymuch.cfg``,
which is created on first run. Settings that can be set there:

query
  The notmuch search query for the messages. Default is
  ``is:unread and is:inbox``.
  
mail_client
  The command to launch the preferred mail client. If empty, the button
  isn't shown. Default is ``gnome-terminal -x mutt -y``.

recency_interval_hours
  Each message is notified about at most once in this time interval. Default is
  ``48``.

hidden_tags
  Tag names that are not shown in the notification. Default is
  ``inbox unread attachment replied sent encrypted signed``.
